# WebCam-Object-Detection
  This project represents the most simple and fast way to implement real time object detection 
in video and webcam with OpenCV and combination of Single Shot Detector with MobileNet. A pretrained
model was used for this purpose (https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD).
