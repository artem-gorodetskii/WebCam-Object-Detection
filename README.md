# WebCam-Object-Detection
  This project represents the most simple and fast way to implement real time object detection 
in video and webcam with OpenCV and combination of Single Shot Detector with MobileNet. A pretrained
model was used for this purpose (https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD). The program 'webcam_object_detection.ipynb' 
allows to detect 20 objects in webcam video stream such as airplanes, bicycles, birds, boats, bottles, buses, cars, 
cats, chairs, cows, dining tables, dogs, horses, motorbikes, people, potted plants, sheep, sofas, trains, 
and tv monitors.
